# Enhancing Travel Industry Insights through Advanced Predictive Modeling

This project explores **Tour & Travel Customer Churn Prediction**, developed during an internship at **CognoRise InfoTech**. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and churn patterns using a dataset that includes customer demographics, service usage, and booking behaviors.

## Project Overview

This analysis is designed to help travel companies identify potential customer churn and make informed decisions to optimize their resources. The dataset includes key indicators such as:

- **Age**: Distribution of customers by age.
- **Frequent Flyer Status**: Identification of frequent flyer customers.
- **Annual Income Class**: Segmentation of customers by income level.
- **Service Usage**: Insights into hotel bookings and travel services usage.
- **Social Media Syncing**: Information on whether customers have linked their social media accounts.

## Data Analysis and Insights

### Age Analysis
- **Objective**: Investigate how different age groups interact with travel services, particularly in social media syncing.
  
### Income Class Insights
- **Objective**: Examine hotel booking patterns across various income classes.
- **Key Insight**: Higher income classes tend to book more hotel tickets and have a higher frequency of travel.
  
### Correlation Study
- **Objective**: Explore the relationship between frequent flyer status and customer booking behavior.
- **Key Finding**: No significant correlation between frequent flyer status and booking behavior.

### Booking Patterns
- **Objective**: Compare hotel booking percentages across different customer demographics.
- **Key Insight**: The majority of customers did not book hotel tickets.

## Predictive Model Summary

To predict customer churn, a basic model was applied, achieving an overall accuracy of **69.7%**. The model showed higher precision in predicting non-booking customers, while future steps will focus on refining the predictions for bookings.
